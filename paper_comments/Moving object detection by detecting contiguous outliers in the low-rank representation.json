LIet al. : WELD FOR ROBUST GRAYSCALE-THERMAL FOREGROUND DETECTION 727 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the methods relevant to our WELD are introduced. We describe the details of WELD and F-WELD in Sections III and IV, respectively. The creation of a grayscale-thermal benchmark and the experiment results on this benchmark are shown in Sections V and VI, respectively. Section VII concludes this paper. II. R ELATED WORK This paper is closely related to the advances in research streams and the development of a grayscale-thermal data set for moving object detection. Single-modality foreground detection has been extensively studied over the past decades. The representative methodsinclude GMMs [7], nonparameter algorithms [9], fuzzy-based methods [25], multiple features-based methods [26], low-rank representation models [13], [27]\u2013[30], and neural and neurofuzzy methods [31]. These work s focus on a single-modality video sequence (thermal information can be viewed as the grayvalue of image), and thus will suffer from the aforementioned challenges, i.e., LI, BW, etc. Multimodality foreground detection has drawn more and more attention in the community [3], [4], [6], [16] with the popularity of various sensors, such as depth sensors and thermal infrared sensors [32]. Davis and Sharma [3] provided a framework for effectively combining information from thermal and visible videos. They first identified the initialregions-of-interest in the thermal domain, and then propagated it into the grayscale domain. The contour saliency map was obtained by combining both thermal and grayscale informationon the detected regions-of-interest, and further flood-filled to produce silhouettes. Han and Bhanu [4] proposed a hierarchical scheme to automatically align synchronous grayscale and thermal frames, and probabilistically combined cues from registered grayscale-thermal frames for improvinghuman silhouette detection. Davis and Sharma [16] proposed a new background-subtraction technique fusing contours from thermal and grayscale videos for persistent objectdetection in urban settings. Using the region saliency detection method in [6], infrared and visible images were integrated with different strategies applied for salient and nonsalient regions. The background subtraction method is then employed using GMM. Low-rank representation has been recently applied to background modeling and achieved impressive results in challenging scenarios. The framework of robust principalcomponent analysis (RPCA) has drawn a lot of attention in computer vision. The seminal work in [12] showed that the low-rank model can be recovered from unknowncorruption patterns by principal component pursuit (PCP), a convex program. The examples in [12] justify the superior performance of PCP against the previous methods of RPCA and its promising potential for background subtraction. Zhou et al. [33] proposed stable PCP (SPCP), an extension of PCP, to handle both sparse gross errors and small entrywise noises. PCP and SPCP relaxed l 0-penalty to l1-penalty for convex optimization. However, the l0-penaltyTABLE I CHALLENGES OF OURDATASETAGAINST OTHER PUBLIC GRAYSCALE -THERMAL DATASETS.HEREIN ,THE CHALLENGES INCLUDE I M ,L I ,B W ,I S ,D S ,B C , AND TC. F ORMORE DETAILS ,PLEASE REFER TO TABLE II works effectively for sparse noise detection in regression, while l1-penalty does not [34]. The work, DEtecting Contiguous Outliers in the LOw-rank Representation(DECOLOR), [13] keeps l 0-penalty to preserve the robustness to outliers, and also modeled the continuity earlier on foreground masks to improve the accuracy of detecting contiguous outliers. There have been several grayscale-thermal video data sets for various vision tasks. For example, the OSU color-thermal data set [16] contains six the rmal/color video sequence pairs recorded from two different locations with only peoplemoving. Two other grayscale-th ermal data sets are collected in [17] and [18]. Most of them, however, suffer from their limited size, low diversity, and high bias. This paper addresses this issue and creates a reasonable size grayscale-thermal video data set that provides comprehensive evaluations. Table Ipresents the challenges of our data set against other public grayscale-thermal data sets. III. WELD A LGORITHM Given a grayscale-thermal vid eo pair, we solve the moving object detection in a batch way and adaptively incorporate the information from different modalities by their respective video quality. A. Model Formulation We formulate the problem of grayscale-thermal foreground detection in a low-rank representation framework due to its robustness to noise. For the kth modal video, we stack each frame as column vectors into a matrix, i.e., Dk=",

The third cla ssifier aimed to minimize false positive detection by analysing temporal correl ations between consecutive frames. In this work the state of the art models classify pixels into b ackground or foreground whereas the proposed work makes decisions on blocks that is group of pixels. Zhou et. al. [16] proposed a framework for \u201cDEtecting Contiguous Outliers in the LOw rank Representation (DECOLOR) \u201d in video sequence. The main contribution of this model is to detect moving object and BG simultaneously without training seque nce and can be discussed as:In this model, a matrix composed of vectorised frame sequence is app roximated by a (RPCA based) matrix having low rank property and the outliers in thi s low rank matrix can be represented as moving object. In video sequences, the moving objects are usually shown in small clusters. So the outliers support is explicitly modelled for contiguous regions. This ca n be done using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) which is proposed by [16]. The motion of BG see n due to camera motion, a parametric motion model is used to resolve this issue. This model has some merits and demerits. As it avoids the complicated motion by proposing outlier detection and make low rank modelling suitable for dealing with complex BG. The DECOLOR work in batch mode, therefore, not suitable for object detection in real time system. Haines et. al. [17] proposed a BGS method using Dirichlet process Gaus sian mixture model for estimating per pixel BG distribution for both, colour a nd thermal video sequences. This method was unable to handle sudden complex light change i n indoor video surveillance. Because of GMM this model is able to handle dynamic BG and detect moving object, having dynamic BG very well. ",
